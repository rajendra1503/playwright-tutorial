# ðŸ§ª Playwright Locator Test â€“ `getByText()` & `getByRole()` Demo

This document explains a Playwright test that uses `getByText()` to validate visible text content on the Web Orders application after login. It also explains the use of `getByLabel()` for inputs and `getByRole()` for the button.

---

## âœ… Purpose

This test demonstrates how to:
- Use `getByLabel()` to interact with form fields based on their labels.
- Use `getByRole()` to click a button (since buttons typically donâ€™t have associated `<label>`s).
- Use `getByText()` to match and assert visible text on the post-login page.
- Use both exact and case-insensitive text matching in assertions.

---

## ðŸš€ Steps Performed

1. Navigate to the Web Orders login page.
2. Assert that the title is `"Web Orders Login"`.
3. Use `getByLabel()` to:
   - Fill the Username and Password fields.
4. Use `getByRole()` to click the Login button.
5. Assert that the new page title is `"Web Orders"`.
6. Use `getByText()` to:
   - Assert that the text `"List of All Orders"` is visible.
   - Demonstrate case-insensitive matching using a regular expression.

## ðŸ’» Test Code

```javascript
//@ts-check

import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('getByText locator demo', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('http://secure.smartbearsoftware.com/samples/testcomplete11/WebOrders/login.aspx');

    await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Web Orders Login');

    await page.getByLabel('Username:').fill('Tester');
    await page.getByLabel('Password:').fill('test');
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' }).click();

    await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Web Orders');

    // Validate text 'List of All Orders' is present and visible on the page
    await expect(page.getByText('List of All Orders')).toBeVisible();

    // Case-insensitive match using RegExp
    await expect(page.getByText(/list of All Orders/i)).toBeVisible();
});

ðŸ§  Locator & Assertion Explanation
ðŸ”¹ getByText('List of All Orders')
Finds an element that visibly contains the exact text "List of All Orders".

Whitespace is normalized; inner HTML formatting is ignored.

By default, it is case-sensitive.

ðŸ”¹ getByText(/list of All Orders/i)
Uses a regular expression with the i flag for case-insensitive matching.

Useful when the exact casing may vary or you want partial matches.

ðŸ”¹ getByLabel(...) and getByRole(...)
getByLabel() is used to find input fields by their associated visible labels (even if not wrapped in actual <label> tags).

getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' }) locates the login button, which is an <input type="submit"> (implicitly has role "button").

ðŸ”¹ expect(...).toBeVisible()
Asserts that the selected element is both present in the DOM and visible to the user.

ðŸ”¹ expect(page).toHaveTitle(...)
Confirms navigation and that login was successful by verifying page titles.

ðŸ“˜ When to Use getByText()
Scenario	Recommendation
Static text in headings	âœ… Use getByText() or getByRole()
Alerts, success messages	âœ… Use getByText()
Matching flexible content	âœ… Use RegExp with getByText()
Semantic targeting	Prefer getByRole() when possible

ðŸ§¾ Notes
Mixing locator strategies (getByLabel, getByRole, getByText) gives you power and flexibility.

Tests written this way are more maintainable and accessibility-friendly.
